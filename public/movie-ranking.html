<h1>Best Movies According To Fizan!!!</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Movies:</h2>

<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>Excellent movie as I had followed the marvel series 
    since as a young child. Movie had great cinematic features and special effects. Really did make you engulfed within the movie.

<h3>Insidious</h3>
<p>One of the scariest movies in my eyes, had lots of jump scares and scary moments.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>My favourite anime movie. This anime has one of the best effects in anime history.
